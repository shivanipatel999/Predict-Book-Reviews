PROCEDURE:

•	Select any dataset from the azure ML studio.

•	Categorize the data in the dataset using Edit Metadata Operation and Group the categorized data using Group Categorical Values Operation.

•	Preprocess the data to remove the repeating words, stop words, and canonicalize dataset.

•	Split the data into two parts one consisting of training data and other consisting of testing data.

•	Use Extract N-grams Features to extract any number of words you want the prediction for.

•	Apply Two-class Logistic Regression and Train the model.

•	After training the model apply Score Data and input the result generated by trained model and test dataset.

•	Final step is to use Evaluate Model to evaluate the scores resulted from the Scored Model.
